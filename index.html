        <p>
          The Little Typer provides an introduction to the field of writing programs that are proofs.
          This includes writing proofs with Proof Assistants and programming in Dependently Typed Programming Languages like <a href="https://lean-lang.org">Lean</a>, <a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a> and <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a>.
          These tools allow us to not only prove that our critical code is correct, but also to write mathematical proofs in a way in which we can collaborate with other authors on github.
          If you would like a larger taste of the topic, see our <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/a-taste-of-coq-and-correct-code-by-construction-111bf74d3b98">blog post</a> or video:

        <h2>Examples of people that might be interested</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/a-programmers-regret-neglecting-math-at-university-9d937655752b">
                You are a computer science student, but struggle to find the motivation to understand mathematical proofs
              </a>
            </li>
            <li>You are a mathematics student trying to understand how their skills can be applicable for programming in industry.</li>
            <li>You are a working programmer looking for a new challenge.</li>
            <li>You are a Mathematician looking for a better way to collaborate.</li>
            <li>Anyone with a basic understanding of recursion.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          You do not need to be an experienced programmer or be a able to write or read mathematical proofs.
          You do need to be able to write code that uses recursion. 
          For example, if you at some stage were able to write a sorting algorithm using recursion or you can now write a program to calculate the length of a linked list using recursion, then you meet the requirements.
          If you have not done this before we recommend reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/">The Little Schemer</a> first.
        </p>

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>
        Each Wednesday starting 5 March 2025 we will discuss chapters we have read and exercises we completed for that week.
        The schedule is quite intense. It is not a lot to read, but it is a lot to grasp and each week has exercises.
        We estimate that this will be about 2 to 5 hours of work per week for 10 weeks.
        More details of the schedule can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/funexists/2025-stellenbosch">github repository</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
          Around Stellenbosch University. The exact location is TBD.
        </p>
